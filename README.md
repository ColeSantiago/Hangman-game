# Nintendo Hangman

This is a Nintendo themed Hangman game made of pure Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The user will get a random word. Wins, losses, remaining guesses, and used letters are all kept track of, and if the user gets four or more letters wrong they will have the option of receiving a hint. Different sounds will play depending on if the user wins, losses, or if they choose to use a hint.
